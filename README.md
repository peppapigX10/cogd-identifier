This project is also trained on how it should respond using a KNN model.

## How to Use
1.Type your thought
2. Press analyze! (Sometimes you got to press it twice)
The AI will show you the top three cognitive distortions it could be with it's confidence percentage!

## Features
- Find three closest cognitive distortions with confidence percentage
- Graph of all cognitive distortions you've submitted
