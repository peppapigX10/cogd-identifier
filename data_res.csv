Labeling,I notice you're using a harsh label to define yourself. What specific behavior are you concerned about?
Labeling,That's a tough way to describe yourself. Can you identify what actually happened without the label?
Labeling,You're defining your entire identity by one characteristic. What evidence contradicts this label?
Labeling,Let's separate the behavior from who you are as a person. What specifically occurred?
Labeling,This label feels very global. Can we look at the specific situation instead?
Labeling,You're more than one trait or mistake. What else is true about you?
Labeling,"Instead of saying I am X, can you say I did X? There's an important difference."
Labeling,That's a harsh judgment. Would you describe a friend this way for the same situation?
Labeling,What facts support this label? What facts contradict it?
Labeling,Labels can become self-fulfilling. What would happen if you described yourself differently?
Labeling,You've attached a permanent label to a temporary situation. How does that serve you?
Labeling,"Can you describe what happened in neutral, factual terms without labeling yourself?"
Mind Reading,How do you know what they're thinking? What evidence supports this belief?
Mind Reading,Have you asked them directly what they're thinking? Our assumptions are often inaccurate.
Mind Reading,It sounds like you're assuming you know their thoughts. What other explanations could there be?
Mind Reading,Can you actually read minds? What facts do you have versus what you're assuming?
Mind Reading,You're treating your assumption as a fact. What if you're wrong about what they're thinking?
Mind Reading,What would happen if you checked this assumption by asking them?
Mind Reading,"Are you basing this on their actual words, or your interpretation of their behavior?"
Mind Reading,What percentage certain are you about what they're thinking? Can you be 100 percent sure?
Mind Reading,"If you can't know for certain, what's a more balanced way to view this situation?"
Mind Reading,What's the worst they could say if you asked them directly about this?
Mind Reading,You're filling in gaps with negative assumptions. What neutral or positive thoughts could they have?
Mind Reading,How often have your assumptions about others' thoughts been proven wrong in the past?
Catastrophizing,You're imagining a worst-case scenario. What's the most likely outcome based on past experience?
Catastrophizing,Let's examine the evidence. What's actually likely to happen versus what you're imagining?
Catastrophizing,You're predicting disaster. What's the best case? What's the realistic case?
Catastrophizing,"Even if the worst happened, how would you cope? What resources do you have?"
Catastrophizing,This feels overwhelming. Let's break it down into what you can actually control right now.
Catastrophizing,You're jumping to the end of a disaster movie. What are the actual facts of the current situation?
Catastrophizing,What percentage chance is there that this worst-case scenario actually happens?
Catastrophizing,You've survived 100 percent of your worst days so far. What does that tell you?
Catastrophizing,Let's plan for realistic challenges instead of imagining catastrophes. What's actually likely?
Catastrophizing,You're fortune-telling a terrible future. What evidence supports this prediction?
Catastrophizing,What would you tell a friend who was catastrophizing about this same situation?
Catastrophizing,Anxiety makes us imagine the worst. What would a calmer version of you say about this?
All or Nothing,I'm noticing black-and-white thinking here. What might the middle ground look like?
All or Nothing,Life rarely exists in extremes. Can you identify any gray areas in this situation?
All or Nothing,You're thinking in terms of always or never. What about sometimes?
All or Nothing,"What would good enough look like, rather than perfect or complete failure?"
All or Nothing,Can you think of a time when you were somewhere in the middle on this?
All or Nothing,You're seeing two options. What other options exist between these extremes?
All or Nothing,Perfect and terrible aren't the only possibilities. What's in between?
All or Nothing,This is either-or thinking. What about partial success? What about progress?
All or Nothing,You're judging in extremes. Where might you actually fall on a spectrum?
All or Nothing,"Instead of I always or I never, can you say I sometimes?"
All or Nothing,What percentage of the time does this actually happen? Is it really all or nothing?
Overgeneralizing,You're making a broad conclusion from one event. How often has this actually happened?
Overgeneralizing,Let's be specific. Can you think of times when this wasn't true?
Overgeneralizing,You used the word always or never. Is this really a pattern or one isolated incident?
Overgeneralizing,One example doesn't make a universal rule. What are the exceptions?
Overgeneralizing,You're generalizing from a single situation. What does the full picture look like?
Overgeneralizing,"Is this happening 100 percent of the time, or are you focusing on negative examples?"
Overgeneralizing,What evidence contradicts this generalization? When has the opposite been true?
Overgeneralizing,You're using one data point to draw a sweeping conclusion. What about all the other data points?
Overgeneralizing,Let's count. How many times has this actually occurred versus how many times it hasn't?
Overgeneralizing,Replace always with sometimes or never with rarely. How does that change the statement?
Overgeneralizing,"What would a more accurate, specific description of the pattern be?"
Fortune Telling,You're predicting the future. What evidence supports this prediction?
Fortune Telling,How accurate have your past predictions been? Do you have a crystal ball?
Fortune Telling,You don't know what will happen. What could you do to prepare instead of predict?
Fortune Telling,"Let's focus on what you can control right now, rather than what might happen later."
Fortune Telling,What if you're wrong about this prediction? What other outcomes are possible?
Fortune Telling,You're treating a possibility as a certainty. What's the difference?
Fortune Telling,What percentage confident are you in this prediction? Is it really 100 percent?
Fortune Telling,You've been wrong about the future before. Why is this prediction definitely accurate?
Fortune Telling,"Instead of I will fail, can you say I might face challenges? How does that feel different?"
Fortune Telling,What evidence from your past contradicts this negative prediction?
Fortune Telling,"If you weren't fortune-telling, what would you focus on instead?"
Emotional Reasoning,"Your feelings are real, but are they giving you accurate information about the situation?"
Emotional Reasoning,Just because you feel something doesn't make it objectively true. What does the evidence say?
Emotional Reasoning,You're using your emotions as evidence. What are the actual facts?
Emotional Reasoning,I hear that you feel this way. Can we separate your emotions from what's actually happening?
Emotional Reasoning,Feelings aren't facts. What would someone without these feelings see in this situation?
Emotional Reasoning,You feel like a failure. Does feeling that way mean you are one?
Emotional Reasoning,What would the evidence say if we removed the emotional lens?
Emotional Reasoning,"Your emotions are valid, but they might be exaggerating or distorting the reality. What's neutral and true?"
Emotional Reasoning,"If your feelings changed, would the facts change? That tells us something important."
Emotional Reasoning,Let's list feelings in one column and facts in another. How do they differ?
Emotional Reasoning,"What would a trusted friend say about this situation, looking at just the facts?"

Personalizing,"What would a fair, balanced view of responsibility look like here?"
Personalizing,You're personalizing an impersonal situation. What external factors played a role?
Discounting,You're dismissing something positive. Why doesn't this count in your mind?

Discounting,You're minimizing the positive. Would you discount this if it happened to someone you care about?
Discounting,What would it take for you to accept this accomplishment without qualification?
Discounting,You added a but that erased the positive. Can you let the positive stand on its own?
